# Recommender-System
This notebook will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. <br>

Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.

For some companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Hotstar, the business model and its success revolves around the potency of their recommendations. Netflix even offered a million dollars in 2009 to anyone who could improve its system by 10%.
